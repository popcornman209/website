                I'm currently working on a working programable computer inside of a game called Scrap Mechanic. It is made using only logic gates, which can be and, or, xor, and then the reverse versions of those. It is going to be fully programable using a compiler I will make in python, which will convert assembly to binary code the computer can understand.<br><br>
                So far I have only completed the drive, and the ram. Below there are photos of the drive, which can hold 16 kilobits of binary data. the last photo has all of the connections<br><br>
                (each dot is a logic gate, and the lines are connections from one logic gate to another)
            </p>
            <h3>this is a photo of the drive</h3>
