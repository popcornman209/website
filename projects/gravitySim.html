            <h1 class="projectName">Gravity Simulator</h1>
            <p>This is just a simple gravity simulator made in python from scratch, it just uses the turtle library for graphics. The main part is just a module that you can import, and really easily use. I did this as I was making a bunch of versions, some with collisions and others not, and I didnt want to have to code it every time.</p>
            <p>Later I made a simple version of it in unity, which allowed a much better way to controll the camera (as the turtle library is... limited to say the least) and also a easier collision system.</p>
            <p>If you want to check out the source code, you can see its Github page <a href="https://github.com/popcornman209/Python_gravity_sim" target="_blank">here</a></p>
