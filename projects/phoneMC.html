            <h1 class="projectName">Phone in Minecraft</h1>
            <p>I made, and am still updating a phone that I made in minecraft, using a mod called computer craft. Its a mod that adds computers that you can code with lua.</p>
            <p>The main reason you can do alot with these phones is mostly because of 2 main features that the mod adds. One of them is super basic, its just reading and writing files, which allows me to make the phone open and run other files, list all apps, and many other things. the other feature is called "rednet" but its basically just a simple way to make computers communicate with each other, similar to websockets (which this mod has support for, yes full http support).</p>
            <p>The phone automatically checks the current version of an app by connecting to a server I have constantly running, and the newest available and will update if needed. this means I can update apps on the server, and all phones will update. I can also create apps and upload them to the app store, and you can easily download them</p>
            <p>Theres alot to talk about, and i dont want to make this page a whole essay, so Ill stop talking here, but the github page is <a href="https://github.com/popcornman209/ccPhone" target="_blank">here</a></p>
